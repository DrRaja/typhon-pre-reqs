@VirginAmerica hi I just booked a flight but need to add baggage, how can I do this?


@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt


@VirginAmerica not worried, it's been a great ride in a new plane with great crew. All airlines should be like this.
